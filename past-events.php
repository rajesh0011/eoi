                                Do you know that genetically, men and women’s DNA is 98.5 % identical. They even have the same hormones! It’s actually the ratios of those hormones and the chemical reactions they trigger that are responsible for all the differences between men & women. Also their brains are literally wired differently. Interesting, isn’t it? We organised a fun session and presented a humorous take with some fascinating data on how men and women think and behave in various contexts. The session was conducted by Aseem and Robin Sawan, for our member entrepreneurs participating with their better halves, and the session was an instant hit.

                                Working with Entrepreneurs is our passion at #EntrepreneursOfInterest - EOI, hosted an insightful session in Chandigarh on #Personalwealthmanagement. The session was jointly facilitated by expert speaker Mr. Rohit Sarin, Co-Founder of a private wealth management company based out of Gurgaon and Aseem Hanspal founder of EOI, ScaleUp Expert & Strengths Coach. It was exciting to see the insightful questions by participants, as Personal Wealth Management is indeed a highly important yet a tricky proposition for entrepreneurs and those belonging to business families. Creating wealth is an art and hiring a professional knowledgeable financial planner/ advisor is the foremost step every business owner must consider, be it any stage of business.

                                Do you know what is the most common denominator for successful and flourishing companies? Undoubtedly, it is the presence of a high-performing team! A high performing team increases productivity, enhances creativity, boosts employee morale & engagement, and consistently drives customer satisfaction upwards. In an essence, success of your endeavor depends a lot on how you build your team and unlock their potential. We conducted an insightful session for members of our Entrepreneurs of Interest (EOI) - Chandigarh Chapter last week facilitated by Aseem Hanspal, Founder of EOI Community; where we explored basic principles of leadership and how to leverage potential of your ‘A’ team.

                                Entrepreneurship is both physically and mentally taxing. And while it is not surprising to find an entrepreneur swamped with work while chasing their dream, a fit #Entrepreneur is undoubtedly a better leader! We organized a session last week on “Fitness in Routine” by Mihika Wahi Gupta for our community of Entrepreneurs at #EOI – Chandigarh Chapter (a SKOPE Initiative). Mihika Wahi Gupta runs “Mission Healthy with Mihika” as a #Fitness Entrepreneur with over 10 years of experience as a Fitness Coach and Influencer. She talks about fitness and healthy lifestyle and believes that ‘healthy’ is the new ‘happy’. The session was an eye opener!!
